# Technical Runbook

## Execution Plan


### Step 1: Build the Questionnaire Engine

**Inputs:** Service-specific questions, branching logic rules, UX/UI wireframes, client data fields

**Outputs:** Fully functional, responsive questionnaire that adapts to answers, supports save/resume, and validates input.

**Tools:** Next.js 14, React Hook Form, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.


### Step 2: Develop the Persona Generator

**Inputs:** Completed questionnaire data, service mapping rules, persona templates.

**Outputs:** Detailed client persona object (business profile, target audience, market size, location, service needs) stored in the database

**Tools:** Node.js 20, NestJS, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL.


### Step 3: Configure Service Integrations

**Inputs:** Persona data, service-specific API credentials, configuration scripts.

**Outputs:** Connected agency services (SEO tracking, development project setup, LMS enrollment, analytics) ready for immediate execution.

**Tools:** Google Analytics API, SEMrush API, Notion API, Stripe API, SendGrid, internal service APIs.


### Step 4: Implement Lifecycle Automation

**Inputs:** Client milestones, communication templates, scheduling logic.

**Outputs:** Automated onboarding emails, milestone reminders, upsell campaigns, and renewal prompts

**Tools:** BullMQ job queues, SendGrid API, Zapier, Redis.


### Step 5: Build the Reporting Module

**Inputs:** Service data feeds (SEO rankings, project milestones, training completion), reporting templates, KPI definitions.

**Outputs:** Automated KPI and ROI reports, delivered monthly to clients with visual dashboards.

**Tools:** Datadog, Chart.js/Recharts, PostgreSQL queries, Google Analytics API.


### Step 6: Develop Role-Based Dashboards

**Inputs:** User roles/permissions, UI component library, data endpoints.

**Outputs:** Custom dashboards for clients, agency owners, service specialists, and admins with relevant metrics and actions

**Tools:** Next.js 14, shadcn/ui, Zustand, NextAuth.js, RBAC middleware.


### Step 7: Implement QA & Automated Testing Suite

**Inputs:** Test case library, API endpoints, UI components, database schema

**Outputs:** Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with coverage reports; detection of critical issues before deployment.

**Tools:** Jest, Playwright, Postman, GitHub Actions CI/CD, ESLint.


### Step 8: Apply Security Hardening & Compliance

**Inputs:** Security audit checklist, compliance regulations (GDPR, CCPA, Australian Privacy Act), penetration testing results.

**Outputs:** Secure application with patched vulnerabilities, proper role-based access controls, encryption in transit and at rest, compliance audit logs.

**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Snyk, AWS Secrets Manager, TLS 1.3 configuration, IAM roles.


### Step 9: Optimize Performance & Scalability

**Inputs:** Load testing results, API latency metrics, database query performance logs.

**Outputs:** System tuned to handle high concurrency (500+ onboardings), API response times <500ms, dashboards loading in <2s under peak load.

**Tools:** k6 for load testing, Datadog APM, Redis caching, AWS CloudFront CDN.


### Step 10: Deploy to Production & Enable Monitoring

**Inputs:** Final build artifacts, environment variables, infrastructure-as-code templates.

**Outputs:** Live production environment with automated deployments, uptime monitoring, error tracking, and rollback capability.

**Tools:** AWS ECS Fargate, Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Datadog monitoring, Sentry error tracking.


## Validation

### Tests
- Unit Tests: Questionnaire logic, persona mapping, API request handlers.  Integration Tests: All third-party API connections (SEMrush, Google Analytics, SendGrid, Stripe).  E2E Tests: Full onboarding to project activation in staging.  Load Tests: Handle 500 concurrent onboardings with API latency <500ms.  Email Deliverability Test: All lifecycle emails sent and received with DKIM/SPF pass.  Security Test: Penetration test with no exploitable vulnerabilities.  Failover Test: Simulate AWS region outage — app must fail over to backup region within 60 seconds

### Quality Gates
- Test Coverage ≥ 90% on all critical modules.  API Latency < 500ms for 95% of requests.  Dashboard Load Time < 2s for authenticated users.  Zero Critical Bugs open in GitHub Issues before deployment.  No Unhandled Promise Rejections in logs during staging runs.

### Manual Checks
- Manually complete an onboarding flow to verify logic and UX clarity.  Review generated persona and confirm all fields correctly populated.  Test each service integration in a real account sandbox.  Manually trigger lifecycle automation to confirm template rendering.  Open all dashboard views to check layout, role-based access, and data accuracy.  Manually review email content for grammar, tone, and personalization.

## Environment

### Environment Variables
- DATABASE_URL
- REDIS_URL
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- GOOGLE_API_KEY
- SEMRUSH_API_KEY
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- JWT_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET

### Secrets Policy
Storage: All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault — never in .env for production.

Access: Restricted by IAM roles with least privilege; only build/deploy pipelines and authorized services can retrieve.

Rotation: All API keys and tokens rotated every 90 days; database passwords rotated every 180 days.

Audit: Every secret access event logged in AWS CloudTrail and reviewed quarterly.

Development: Local .env.local files are .gitignored and use dummy or sandbox credentials.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions uses OIDC to request temporary secrets from AWS, eliminating the need for stored static keys.
