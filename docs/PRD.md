# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Statement

Agencies waste hours manually onboarding clients, collecting info in scattered formats, and configuring multiple tools. This delays project start times and reduces efficiency. A unified CRM that automates onboarding and ongoing service delivery could save 10–15 staff hours per client, while improving client satisfaction and retention.

## Goals

- Reduce onboarding-to-active-project time to under 2 hours.  Achieve 90% questionnaire completion rate on first session.  Auto-generate project plans for 100% of onboarded clients.  Integrate with at least 10 core agency tools/APIs at launch.  Deliver automated monthly client reports without human input.  Maintain 99.9% uptime for client-facing dashboards.  Enable upsell automation that drives a 15% increase in average contract value.

## Target Users

- Agency Owners — Need a central place to manage all services for each client.  Account Managers — Want automated updates, task tracking, and communication logs.  Clients (SMEs) — Expect fast onboarding, clear visibility, and responsive support.  Service Specialists — Developers, SEO experts, trainers — need pre-populated work queues from onboarding data.  Operations/Admin Staff — Require reporting, invoicing, and compliance tracking.
