# Initial Requirements

## Feature Description

Core Feature: An AI-driven onboarding engine that transforms a detailed business questionnaire into a fully populated CRM client profile, complete with service recommendations, project timelines, and integrations into operational tools. Once onboarded, the system will run lifecycle automation — project updates, milestone tracking, marketing campaigns, service upsells, support requests, and training invites — without manual intervention.

Value Proposition: Drastically reduce time-to-value by eliminating fragmented onboarding processes. Clients leave the initial 1-hour session with a live, operational account already preloaded with strategy documents, active campaigns, and project schedules.

User Interaction: Clients are guided through a smart, branching questionnaire that asks only relevant questions based on prior answers. Upon completion, they’re given access to a personalized dashboard showing active projects, KPIs, messages, and offers.

## Context

Agencies spend disproportionate time gathering client info and setting up services. This delays deliverables and weakens first impressions.

Market context: SMEs are investing in all-in-one agency relationships, preferring vendors who can handle consultation, development, marketing, and training in one place.

The opportunity: Build a CRM with embedded agency IP — questionnaires, onboarding flows, service playbooks — so agencies deliver full-stack value instantly.
